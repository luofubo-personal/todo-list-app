# Todo List Application Testing Guide

## How to Test the Application

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Test all functionality described below
3. Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
4. Check browser compatibility

## Features to Test

### 1. Adding Todos
- Type text in the input field
- Click "Add" button or press Enter
- Verify todo appears in the list
- Verify input field clears after adding
- Try adding empty todos (should be prevented)

### 2. Marking Todos as Complete
- Click the checkbox next to a todo
- Verify the todo text gets a strikethrough
- Verify the todo text becomes gray
- Click the checkbox again to mark as incomplete
- Verify styling returns to normal

### 3. Deleting Todos
- Click the "Delete" button on a todo
- Verify the todo is removed from the list
- Verify the todo is removed from localStorage

### 4. Data Persistence
- Add several todos
- Mark some as complete
- Close and reopen the browser
- Verify todos are still there with correct completion status
- Try in different browsers

### 5. Responsive Design
- Test on desktop, tablet, and mobile views
- Verify layout adjusts appropriately
- Verify touch targets are adequate on mobile
- Verify form elements are usable on all screen sizes

## Expected Behavior

### Adding Todos
- New todos should appear at the bottom of the list
- Input should be trimmed of leading/trailing spaces
- Empty todos should not be added
- Input field should be focused after adding

### Completing Todos
- Completed todos should have strikethrough text
- Completed todos should be gray
- Completion status should persist after page refresh

### Deleting Todos
- Deleted todos should be immediately removed from view
- Deleted todos should not reappear after page refresh

### Data Persistence
- All todos should be saved to localStorage
- Todos should be loaded from localStorage on page load
- Data should persist between browser sessions

## Troubleshooting

### Todos Not Saving
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify localStorage is enabled in browser
- Check for JavaScript errors in console

### Styling Issues
- Verify all CSS files are loaded correctly
- Check browser developer tools for CSS errors
- Verify browser compatibility

### JavaScript Not Working
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify script.js is loaded correctly
- Check browser JavaScript is enabled

## Browser Compatibility
The application should work in all modern browsers:
- Chrome 50+
- Firefox 50+
- Safari 10+
- Edge 15+

## Performance Considerations
- Application should load quickly
- Adding todos should be instantaneous
- Marking complete/incomplete should be instantaneous
- Deleting todos should be instantaneous
